# Rolling-bearing-fault-diagnosis
(Leveraging multiple deep learning models for fault diagnosis)
The purpose of creating this repository is to improve my programming skills, while also providing a new perspective for those interested in this field. I will continue to update this repository regularly.

The workflow of the entire repository is divided into the following steps:

## 1.Data Processing
The data used in this repository is the bearing fault diagnosis dataset from **Jiangnan University**. We first generate our training samples using techniques such as resampling, sliding window sampling, and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).
